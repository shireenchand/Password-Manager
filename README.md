# Password-Manager
This program stores all your passwords in one place which can only be accessed using an entry password.


This program uses Tkinter for the GUI of the password manager and sqlite to store all the passwords. It includes seeing a specific password, seeing all passwords,
updating passwords, adding passwords and also deleting passwords. All of this can only be accessed using an entry password.



The current password for entry has been set to "hello". It can be changed to a different one at line 34.
Also when the program is run for the first time uncomment the lines 16 to 29 to create the table. After first run, comment it out.
